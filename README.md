Dynamic Parking Pricing - Summer Analytics 2025

- Overview

This project builds a dynamic pricing engine for urban parking lots to optimize utilization using real-time data, designed for the Summer Analytics Capstone by the Consulting & Analytics Club.

It implements:

Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing (price increases linearly with occupancy)

Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing (adjusts prices using occupancy, queue length, traffic, vehicle type, and special days)

These models help manage demand, reduce congestion, and improve efficiency in urban parking management.

- Tech Stack

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

- Files
dataset.csv : Contains Dataset used to train this models

Dynamic_Parking_Pricing.ipynb: Core Colab-ready notebook containing clean implementation of Models 1 & 2.

Dynamic_Parking_Pricing_Models.csv: Contains the generated dynamic pricing outputs for analysis and plotting.

- Instructions

1. Place dataset.csv in the same directory.

2. Run the notebook to generate dynamic prices for each parking lot across timestamps.
